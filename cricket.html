    <h1>WPL</h1>
    <p class="error">It was a territory of known unknowns. The Women's Premier League 
        (WPL) franchises may not have exactly foreseen how the auction 
        would pan out, much like the 2008 IPL auction when the owners and 
        their representatives were clueless and even more inexperienced. 
        With three of the five franchises having 15 years of IPL experience 
        and two others being part of recent leagues, the teams definitely 
        knew who they wanted but were not totally sure if they could 
        achieve the targets.</p>

        <h2>Jemimah Rodrigues</h2>

        <p class="error">The roar and a very David Warner-esque celebration said it all. 
            Earnestly religious, Jemimah Rodrigues isn't usually the one 
            with such striking displays of aggression or emotion on the 
            cricket field. But this was special. So, after helping herself 
            to a fifty, and India to a seven-wicket win in their 2023 T20 
            World Cup opener against Pakistan, Rodrigues spent an extra 10 
            seconds dedicating the knock to her supportive parents - her 
            bat raised to their balcony seats at the Newlands - before 
            including a patiently applauding Richa Ghosh in her 
            celebrations.</p>

    <p>Iyer has been sidelined for close to a month with a back injury that ruled 
        him out of the New Zealand ODIs recently. His last appearance for India came 
        in the ODI series against Sri Lanka last month. Even though he was named in 
        the Test squad for the Australia series, Iyer didn't recover in time to join 
        the group for the first Test in Nagpur.
