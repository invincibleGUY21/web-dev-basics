            <h2>It's a me, Mario</h2>
            <p>Australia had gone into the second Test with just one pacer 
                in Pat Cummins, but with the pacer missing the third Test, 
                and with Mitchell Starc still pushing for his own full 
                recovery from injury, Green's presence gives the team a 
                favorable option on the bowling front as well, in addition 
                to what he's been planning with the bat. "In the back of 
                my mind after the game at the MCG, I was looking forward 
                to having a couple of weeks at home just to refresh and 
                then get back into basically sweeping a lot, getting back 
                into my subcontinent skills. Unfortunately, it's been a 
                bit slower than probably what I was expecting, getting 
                back out there and getting my skills up to scratch, said 
                Green who has a Man of the Match award in the subcontinent 
                when Australia won a match in Sri Lanka last year.</p>

        <p>The recovery for the all-rounder comes as a big boost to the 
            visitors who are 0-2 down in the series. Not only does he 
            present a viable right-handed batting option in the 
            middle-order, but can also be an adequate seamer leaving 
            Australia with more options to think about in their playing 
            eleven.</p>
